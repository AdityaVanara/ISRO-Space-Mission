          LVM3 M3/ OneWeb India-2 Mission is accomplished successfully. In its
          sixth consecutive successful flight of LVM3, the vehicle placed 36
          satellites belonging to the OneWeb Group Company in their intended 450
          km circular orbit with an inclination of 87.4 degrees. The vehicle
          took off with a total payload of 5,805 kg at 09:00:20 hours IST from
          the second launch pad at SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota. It achieved satellite
          injection conditions in about 17 minutes and began injecting the
          satellites from the twentieth minute. The vehicle performed a
          sophisticated manoeuvre to orient in orthogonal directions and
          injected the satellites into precise orbits with defined time-gaps to
          avoid collision of the satellites.

          OneWeb is a global communication network powered from space, enabling
          connectivity for governments, businesses, and communities. It is
          implementing a constellation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.
          India’s Bharti Enterprises serves as a major investor and shareholder
          in OneWeb.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is OneWeb’s 18th launch, its third this year, bringing the total
          of OneWeb’s constellation to 618 satellites. This launch is a major
          milestone for the company, with the number of satellites now in-orbit
          enabling global service, the first LEO operator to reach this
          milestone. OneWeb will soon be ready to roll out its global coverage.

        <h2>LVM3 M3/OneWeb India-2 mission accomplished successfully</h2>
        <p>
          Mar 26, 2023
          <br />
          Today, ISRO’s LVM3 launch vehicle, in its sixth consecutive successful
          flight placed 36 satellites belonging to OneWeb Group Company into
          their intended 450 km circular orbit with an inclination of 87.4
          degrees. With this, NSIL has successfully executed its contract to
          launch 72 satellites of OneWeb to Low Earth Orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vehicle took off with a total payload of 5,805 kg at 09:00:20
          hours local time from the second launch pad at SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota.
          It gained the required altitude of 450 km in about nine minutes of
          flight, achieved satellite injection conditions in the eighteenth
          minute, and began injecting the satellites in the twentieth minute.
          The C25 stage performed a sophisticated maneuver to repeatedly orient
          itself in orthogonal directions and inject satellites into precise
          orbits with defined time-gaps to avoid collision of the satellites. 36
          satellites were separated in 9 phases, in a batch of 4. OneWeb
          confirmed the acquisition of signals from all 36 satellites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mission marked OneWeb’s second satellite deployment from India,
          highlighting the strong partnership with NSIL and ISRO. It was
          OneWeb’s 18th launch bringing the total of OneWeb’s constellation to
          618 satellites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Shri Somanath S, </b> Secretary, Department of Space and Chairman,
          ISRO congratulated ISRO, NSIL, and OneWeb on the succession mission.
          He expressed happiness over the consecutive successful flight of LVM3,
          the opportunity provided by NSIL and the confidence OneWeb team has in
          ISRO. He thanked the Government for the support and approvals for the
          missions for the commercial launches that have enhanced the confidence
          in LVM3. He was delighted to mention that this mission had the
          upgraded S200 motors with enhanced margins suitable for the upcoming
          Gaganyaan mission and the motors performed very well.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b> Shri Radhakrishnan D, </b>
          Chairman-cum-Managing Director, NewSpace India Limited congratulated
          ISRO for successful and repeatable performance. Terming the event as
          momentous, he recalled the challenge of this complex mission in terms
          of maneuverability.
