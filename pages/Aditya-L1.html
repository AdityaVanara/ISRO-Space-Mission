        <h1>About ADITYA-L1 Mission</h1>
        <p>
          September 1, 2023 <br />
          Aditya-L1 is a satellite dedicated to the comprehensive study of the
          Sun. It has 7 distinct payloads developed, all developed indigenously.
          Five by ISRO and two by Indian academic institutes in collaboration
          with ISRO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aditya in Sanskrit means the Sun. L1 here refers to Lagrange Point 1
          of the Sun-Earth system. For common understanding, L1 is a location in
          space where the gravitational forces of two celestial bodies, such as
          the Sun and Earth, are in equilibrium. This allows an object placed
          there to remain relatively stable with respect to both celestial
          bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following its scheduled launch on September 2, 2023, Aditya-L1 stays
          Earth-bound orbits for 16 days, during which it undergoes 5 maneuvres
          to gain the necessary velocity for its journey. Subsequently,
          Aditya-L1 undergoes a Trans-Lagrangian1 insertion maneuvre, marking
          the beginning of its 110-day trajectory to the destination around the
          L1 Lagrange point. Upon arrival at the L1 point, another maneuvre
          binds Aditya-L1 to an orbit around L1, a balanced gravitational
          location between the Earth and the Sun. The satellite spends its whole
          mission life orbiting around L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit in a
          plane roughly perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strategic placement at the L1 Lagrange point ensures that
          Aditya-L1 can maintain a constant, uninterrupted view of the Sun. This
          location also allows the satellite to access solar radiation and
          magnetic storms before they are influenced by Earth's magnetic field
          and atmosphere. Additionally, the L1 pointâ€™s gravitational stability
          minimizes the need for frequent orbital maintenance efforts,
          optimizing the satellite's operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quick Facts: Aditya-L1 will stay approximately 1.5 million km away
          from Earth, directed towards the Sun, which is about 1% of the
          Earth-Sun distance. The Sun is a giant sphere of gas and Aditya-L1
          would study the outer atmosphere of the Sun. Aditya-L1 will neither
          land on the Sun nor approach the Sun any closer.

        <h2>Science Objectives:</h2>
        <p>The major science objectives of Aditya-L1 mission are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Study of Solar upper atmospheric (chromosphere and corona) dynamics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Study of chromospheric and coronal heating, physics of the partially
            ionized plasma, initiation of the coronal mass ejections, and flares
          </li>
          <li>
            Observe the in-situ particle and plasma environment providing data
            for the study of particle dynamics from the Sun.
          </li>
          <li>Physics of solar corona and its heating mechanism.</li>
          <li>
            Diagnostics of the coronal and coronal loops plasma: Temperature,
            velocity and density.
          </li>
          <li>Development, dynamics and origin of CMEs.</li>
          <li>
            Identify the sequence of processes that occur at multiple layers
            (chromosphere, base and extended corona) which eventually leads to
            solar eruptive events.
          </li>
          <li>
            Magnetic field topology and magnetic field measurements in the solar
            corona .
          </li>
          <li>
            Drivers for space weather (origin, composition and dynamics of solar
            wind .
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Aditya-L1 Payloads:</h2>

        <img src="../Assets/aditya-L1/1.jpg" class="fit-img" />
        <p>
          The instruments of Aditya-L1 are tuned to observe the solar atmosphere
          mainly the chromosphere and corona. In-situ instruments will observe
          the local environment at L1. There are total seven payloads on-board
          with four of them carrying out remote sensing of the Sun and three of
          them carrying in-situ observation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payloads along with their major capability of scientific
          investigation.
